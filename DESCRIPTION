Description: The goal of CLLPackage is to provide alternative methods to estimate 
    coefficients of a linear model. The first method implemented is based on gradient descend
    approach and the second one is based on steepest gradient approach. 
    In order to compute MSE on predictions obtained with a linear model, implementation of a
    k-fold cross-validation function both in sequential and in parallel way is available.
